Testosterone gels are applied topically to the skin and are absorbed through the skin to deliver testosterone into the bloodstream. Here are some common testosterone gel compounds used for TRT:

1. **[[Testosterone Gel (Androgel)]]:** Androgel is one of the most well-known testosterone gels and is available in various strengths. It is applied to clean, dry skin on the shoulders, upper arms, or abdomen once a day.
2. **[[Testosterone Gel (Testim)]]:** Testim is another popular testosterone gel available in different strengths. Like Androgel, it is applied to the skin daily.
3. **[[Testosterone Gel (Fortesta)]]:** Fortesta is a testosterone gel applied to the front and inner thighs. It is also used once daily.
4. **[[Testosterone Gel (Axiron)]]:** Axiron is a testosterone gel that is applied to the underarm area using a specific applicator. It is typically used once daily.
5. **[[Testosterone Gel (Natesto)]]:** Natesto is a unique testosterone nasal gel that is applied through the nose. It is used multiple times a day, usually three times daily.

Testosterone gels are a convenient option for TRT, as they provide a consistent, steady release of testosterone throughout the day. However, it's essential to apply the gel properly to clean, dry skin and to avoid contact with others, especially women and children, as inadvertent transfer of testosterone can occur.
