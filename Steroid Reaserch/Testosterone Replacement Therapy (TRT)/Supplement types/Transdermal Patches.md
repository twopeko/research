Transdermal patches deliver testosterone through the skin and provide a convenient method of hormone delivery. Here are some common testosterone transdermal patch compounds used for TRT:

1. **[[Androderm]]:** Androderm is a well-known testosterone transdermal patch available in different strengths. The patch is applied daily to clean, dry skin on the back, abdomen, thighs, or upper arms.
2. **[[Testopel]]:** Testopel is a unique TRT option where testosterone is implanted subcutaneously in the form of small pellets. The pellets gradually release testosterone over several months, providing a longer-lasting effect.

Testosterone transdermal patches offer a steady release of testosterone into the bloodstream over time, making it a convenient option for some individuals on TRT. As with any form of TRT, the choice of testosterone patch and its dosing will depend on individual needs, medical history, and the prescribing doctor's recommendations.
