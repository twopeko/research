Here are some common injectable testosterone compounds used for TRT:

1. **[[Testosterone Cypionate]]:** Testosterone cypionate is a long-acting ester of testosterone. It is typically injected into the muscle and has a longer half-life, meaning it remains active in the body for an extended period, often requiring less frequent injections.
2. **[[Testosterone Enanthate]]:** Testosterone enanthate is another long-acting ester of testosterone, similar to testosterone cypionate. It is also administered through intramuscular injections.
3. **[[Testosterone Propionate]]:** Testosterone propionate is a short-acting ester of testosterone. It has a shorter half-life and may require more frequent injections compared to cypionate or enanthate.
4. **[[Testosterone Undecanoate]] :** Testosterone undecanoate is a long-acting injectable testosterone that is administered less frequently than some other injectables. It is typically given every few months.

5. **[[Testosterone Isocaproate]]:** Testosterone isocaproate is a less common form of injectable testosterone and is often found in combination with other testosterone esters in certain medication formulations.
6. **[[Mixed Testosterone Esters]] :** These formulations contain a combination of different testosterone esters, providing both fast-acting and longer-acting effects, resulting in less frequent injections.

Each form of injectable testosterone has its advantages and considerations, such as dosing frequency and peak levels. Your doctor will consider factors like your individual needs, medical history, and lifestyle to determine the most suitable form of TRT for you.
