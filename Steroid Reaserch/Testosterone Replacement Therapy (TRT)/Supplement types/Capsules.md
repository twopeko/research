Testosterone pills increase your testosterone levels. Testosterone is a hormone that your sex organs mainly produce. You can take these capsules by mouth with a glass of water as directed.

1. **[[Methyltestosterone]]:** Methyltestosterone is a synthetic form of testosterone available in oral tablets. It has been used for hormone replacement therapy in cases of testosterone deficiency.
2. **[[Testosterone Undecanoate (Andriol)]]:** Testosterone undecanoate is an oral testosterone preparation that comes in soft gel capsules. It is designed to improve absorption and bioavailability.
3. **[[Fluoxymesterone (Halotestin)]]:** Fluoxymesterone is an androgenic-anabolic steroid sometimes used for TRT, although it is less common than other forms of testosterone replacement due to its potentially higher risk of liver toxicity.
4. **[[Testosterone Buccal Tablets]]:** Some TRT formulations come in buccal tablets, which are placed between the cheek and gum to allow for absorption through the oral mucosa.
